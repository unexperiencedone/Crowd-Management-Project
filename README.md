## 📌 Overview
This project predicts crowd levels in Indian Railways compartments using a simulated dataset. The objective is to enhance passenger distribution without requiring major infrastructure changes.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Type:** Simulated dataset (project-specific)
- **Features:** Passenger and travel-related attributes
- **Target:** Crowd level classification — Low, Medium, High, Very High

## 🔍 Approach
1. **Data Generation:** Created a synthetic dataset based on realistic travel patterns.
2. **Preprocessing:** Cleaned data, encoded categorical variables, and scaled numerical features.
3. **Modeling:** Trained and compared multiple machine learning models.
4. **Evaluation:** Measured Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.

## 📊 Results
- **Accuracy:** 95.8%
- **Precision:** 95.7%
- **Recall:** 95.6%
- **F1-Score:** 95.6%

Confusion matrix and classification reports show balanced performance across all crowd levels with minimal misclassification.

## ⚙ Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
